# 👋 Louis Raimbault, PhD Applied Mathematics

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I am passionate about applied mathematics and informatic, the development of **runtime-optimized software with efficient memory management**, and artificial intelligence.  

If you have any remarks or questions, feel free to send me an email at Louis.Raimbault@icloud.com.

## 1) 🧑‍🏫 Presentation

I hold a degree in **statistics**, which I further explored during my doctoral research.  
My work led me to dive deeply into **algorithm design** and **C/C++ optimization**, fields for which I have developed a true passion.  

On this GitHub page, I share some of my work carried out during my PhD as well as personal projects.  
These focus mainly on **data mining**, **statistics**, and **artificial intelligence**, with the goal of combining mathematical rigor with high-performance software development.

## 2) ⛏️ Data Mining Projects

During my PhD, I published **two papers** on the discovery of **frequent itemsets** and **association rules**.  
These works rely on specialized tree structures that enable efficient recursion over items:  
- a **prefix tree** using the **PrefRec** algorithm,  
- a **suffix tree** using the **SufRec** algorithm.  

The **SufRec** algorithm proved to be **significantly more efficient**, and my implementation in C/C++ is both **more refined** and **more effective** than **PrefRec**, making it a strong choice compared to other existing algorithms.

## 3) ⚙️ Data Generator Projects

Since my master's degree, I have developed several **data generators**, each as a personal project, which have helped me in other scientific or professional work.  

The lack of readily available datasets has motivated me to create these new generators.  
They are primarily intended to **train initial models during the testing phase** and cover several types of data.  
⚠️ These datasets **should not be considered perfectly realistic or exhaustive**, but serve as a practical support for development and prototyping.  

💡 Any request for additional types of data or features in the generators can be **taken into consideration**.

## 4) 📊 Statistical Analysis & AI

1) In two of my publications, we proposed **developing and exploiting association rules for statistical purposes**.  
We defined various types of indicators on the rules to study databases ([Wiley article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sam.11620)) and also introduced a method to explain a target variable using a new characterization approach ([Springer article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41060-025-00746-7)).  
This allows for an effective **summary of databases**. Two GitHub repositories were originally created to support these articles, though they currently require updates.

2) My interest in AI, particularly **neural networks**, led me to develop my own **fully-connected neural network implementation in C/C++ from scratch**.  
This initial library aims to provide solutions for AI in **embedded or constrained environments**. Future updates may be provided, but the current version is closely tied to my ongoing work, and the libraries are **not publicly shared** at this time.
